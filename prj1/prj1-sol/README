Message to Grader/TA:
1) I have added the name of the python file containing my Lexer and Parser code, in run.sh.
2) I did not made any changes to make.sh file as I'm using python.
3) I have used 'do-zip.sh' for zipping my project.
4) I have tested my code against all the sample test provided and all of those testcases are passing!
5) Hence, please let me know if you cannot run the project while grading. I can help you showing the output.
